# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to write a full-stack application with the aforementioned technologies with more focus on some. The major focus was on Go and learning idomatic way of writing Go code, scalable project structure, testing practices (unit testing, end-to-end testing, integration testing) and using minimal dependencies.

# Conclusion

The project was very rewarding and gave a lot of confidence to tackle on more difficult projects.

#### The best tools I got from this project

1. How to structure my projects in a way that makes it easier to mock depencies for testing
2. Getting familiar with [pkg.go.dev](pkg.go.dev)
3. Know what to look for when choosing to go with a dependency (check amount of github stars and look at github issues to see if it's getting actively mantained).
4. Automating some of the development and production cycle with Makefile
