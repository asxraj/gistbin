# Project document

[Gistbin](https://gistbin.vercel.app) is a simple version of the popular paste tool **pastebin**

# Technologies

### Backend

- **Go**
- PostgreSQL
- Digitalocean (Ubuntu remote server)
- Caddy as a reverse proxy

### Frontend

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwindcss
- Vercel

# Purpose

1. Write a full-stack application with the aforementioned technologies. Main focus on Go
2. Learn to write idiomatic go code
3. Learn how to best structure the code
4. Testing best-practices with (table-driven testing, unit testing, e2e testing and integration testing)
5. Using minimal go dependencies to learn more under the hood as the abstraction can make that harder.

# Conclusion

The project was very rewarding and gave me a lot of confidence to tackle on more difficult projects in the future.

#### The best tools I got from this project

1. How to structure my projects in a way that makes it easier to mock depencies for testing
2. Getting familiar with [pkg.go.dev](pkg.go.dev)
3. Know what to look for when choosing to go with a dependency (check amount of github stars, look at github issues to see if it's getting actively mantained and is the docs easy to read).
4. Automating some of the development and production cycle with a Makefile
